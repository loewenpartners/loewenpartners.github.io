                    The goal of the project was to leverage machine learning to teach people how to exercise properly with correct form. <br/> <br/>
                    In the summer of 2017 I participated in Microsoft's OneWeek hackathon and brought together a team to make a demo of the project.
                    It was a lot of work (especially as I was the lead project manager and lead developer) but we ended up with a really awesome demo and website which you can see below!
